## Quick Bio
![Me](/assets/images/about.jpg)

 I am currently working on the [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io) programming language. I am currently employed by [WSO2](https://wso2.com). Professionally I program in Java and Ballerina. In my free time I make little things in Go, Rust, and various esoteric programming language that catch my fancy. Personally I like low level programming and compiler/language design. 

# Interesting Projects
## Professional projects
### [jballerina](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang)
Production ready version of Ballerina compiler written in Java. It directly generate JVM bytecode. I am mainly involved in the compiler side while occasionally dipping my toes in runtime.

### [nballerina](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/nballerina) 
Experimental version of Ballerina compiler that is written in Ballerina, with runtime written in C. It can directly generate native executables using llvm. Currently only a subset of the language is supported. 

### [nballerina-cpp](https://github.com/heshanpadmasiri/nballerina-cpp)
Experimental version of Ballerina compiler that takes the BIR (Ballerina Intermediate Representation) from the jballerina compiler and generate native executables using llvm. No longer in active development.

## Personal projects 
### [tree-sitter-ballerina](https://github.com/heshanpadmasiri/tree-sitter-ballerina)
Ballerina grammar for tree-sitter parser. This is currently a work in progress but most the Ballerina syntax should be supported. 

### [pea-server](https://github.com/heshanpadmasiri/pea-server)
File hosting service (similar to drive) that is meant to be run in a NAS. Currently not in active development, since at it's current state it can do all I wanted.

### [ballerina-mode](https://github.com/heshanpadmasiri/ballerina-mode)
Emacs major mode for Ballerina language. This mostly gives things like syntax highlighting and depends on the LSP for most of the complicated tasks (like go to definition).

### [Director](https://github.com/heshanpadmasiri/Director)
Simple file management GUI inspired by [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html)
